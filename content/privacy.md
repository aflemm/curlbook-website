title: "CurlBook Privacy Policy"
---

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted in the CurlBook app on iPad.

### Information Collected
I do not collect any user-generated data, and none of your data is visible to me.

I collect anonymous statistics regarding usage, to help inform future development and features.

### iCloud
CurlBook may store some of your data in Appleâ€™s iCloud service, to enable sync features between all devices signed into your Apple ID. This data is not accessible or visible to me.

### Future
Should user data become visible to me in the future, I will not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish my app's functionality. I may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people are actively using a certain feature.

I may disclose user information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect my rights and property.

In the future, I may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

### Changes to this policy
Future changes to this privacy policy will be posted here.
