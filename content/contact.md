ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Andrew Flemming](https://andrewflemming.net) (he/him). I design, develop, support, sell, and maintain CurlBook. I created CurlBook because I believe that collecting the right data during curling games can unlock insights that will help your team win more games.

If you have questions, need help, or just want to talk about CurlBook, please send me an email at [andrew@curlbook.ca](mailto:andrew@curlbook.ca)
