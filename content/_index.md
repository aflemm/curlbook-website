Intuitive and insightful performance analytics for curling teams.

# Analytics help win games

A single game of curling is a very large, multi-variable dataset. An event, or season's worth of games even more-so.

Trends and tendencies are not always obvious

# Insightful

CurlBook is so much more than a curling stats app. We don't collect game data to hand out gold stars to our player with the best shooting percentage - we do it to uncover the critical trends that will win and lose games in the futre. Knowing this, we can reinforce good trends and course-correct bad ones.
