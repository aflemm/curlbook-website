# Analytics Can Help

A single game of curling is a very large, multi-variable dataset. An event, or season's worth of games even more-so.

Trends and tendencies are not always obvious

This is where software can step in and help

and
- you will be scouted, know more than your competition

Errors and Issues
- Errors are the way a shot is missed (heavy, light, inside, outside)
- Issues are the root causes (brooming, thrower, sweepers, line-call)

# Capture Notes, With Context

During a game, instant note capture is always at your fingertips. More than just a thought, CurlBook saves the context of each note when you create it. Whether it's the current shot, end, or game; either team; or a player, your note will always have the context it needs to be useful.

After the game, all of your notes are collected in one convenient location, never buried.

Sometimes a picture can say 1000 words, and CurlBook drawings are super fast and easy to generate. Have situation worth reviewing? A few taps, maybe some scribbles, and it's saved for post-game.


# Data --> Insights

CurlBook is so much more than a curling stats app. We don't collect game data to hand out gold stars to our player with the best shooting percentage - we do it to uncover the critical trends that will win and lose games in the futre. Knowing this, we can reinforce good trends and course-correct bad ones.

Performance timeline bar charts highlight misses, and make trends obvious at a glance. No more digging through shot scores to uncover meaning

CurlBook introduces brand new stats to help you track performance.
- Make-rate is the percentage of shots scored as 3 or 4, and represents the ratio of impactful shots. 
- Miss-rate is opposite, the percentage of shots scored as 0 or 1, and represents the ratio of damaging shots
- TV stat is the traditional television-broadcast style scoring percentage
- Weighted performance is similar to TV stat but with negative weighting to misses, and it does a better job at highlighting changes in performance
