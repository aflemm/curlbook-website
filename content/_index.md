## Your Assistant Coach

A single game of curling is a very large, multi-variable dataset. An event, or season's worth of games even more-so. Trends and tendencies are not always obvious, but they can make or break your season.

This is where software can step in and help. Let CurlBook crunch the numbers, and expose the strengths and vulnerabilities your team can't afford to miss.

CurlBook is also a fantastic for scouting your opposition. If you knew a team's second was routinely over-curling on their out-turn hits, would you incorporate that into your game plan? What if your opposition knew that about you?

CurlBook tracks shot errors and shot issues:
- Errors are the way a shot is missed (heavy, light, inside, outside)
- Issues are the root causes (brooming, thrower, sweepers, line-call)

## Notes, With Context

During a game, instant note capture is always at your fingertips. More than just a thought, CurlBook saves the context of each note when you create it. Whether it's the current shot, end, or game; either team; or a player, your note will always have the context it needs to be useful.

After the game, all of your notes are collected in one convenient location, never buried.

Sometimes a picture can say 1000 words, and CurlBook drawings are super fast and easy to generate. Have situation worth reviewing? A few taps, maybe some scribbles, and it's saved for post-game.


## Data â†’ Insights

The value of collecting game data is in the insights it generates. We don't hand out all-star awards, we look to uncover the critical trends that will win and lose games in the future. Knowing this, we can reinforce good trends and course-correct bad ones.

CurlBook presents trends over time so it's crystal clear how your practice is paying off.

## Your Data, Visualized

CurlBook shows you a curling game like never seen it before. By being extremely visual with data presentation, the data becomes far more impactful.

Scoreboard story line plots show the flow of scoreboard control through a game. Instantly see the ends that got you into trouble, for quick focusing on real problems.

Performance timeline bar charts highlight misses, and make trends obvious at a glance. No more digging through shot scores to uncover meaning

![](/images/key-stats-breakdown.png)
CurlBook introduces brand new stats to help you track performance.
- Make-rate is the percentage of shots scored as 3 or 4, and represents the ratio of impactful shots. 
- Miss-rate is opposite, the percentage of shots scored as 0 or 1, and represents the ratio of damaging shots
- TV stat is the traditional television-broadcast style scoring percentage
- Weighted performance is similar to TV stat but with negative weighting to misses, and it does a better job at highlighting changes in performance

## Fast & Flexible

CurlBook is fast and easy to use. With an intuitive and iPad-native interface, CurlBook keeps the distraction to a minimum. If you're in a hurry, starting a game takes only one tap. After it's started, everything can be edited later (teams, lineups, event, colours, hammer, etc.) so you're never stuck with a mis-configured game.

CurlBook can track as much or as little as you want to put into it. Just want to track draw weight? CurlBook's flexibility makes it the perfect tool for the job.

CurlBook features an extensible tags system which allows you to track your own custom metrics, and every plot and chart can be filtered by your custom tags.

During data review, filters give you fine-grain control over what you see. Want to see trends in low-precision out-turn hits that were missed by your front-end? CurlBook has you covered.

## Supported Devices

CurlBook is compatible with any iPad running iOS 18.0 or later

## Pricing

CurlBook is directly funded by its users, and sustainably priced to enable continuous development. I am not VC funded; I don't harvest data for resale; I won't nickel and dime with micro-transactions or upgrades; I will never employ 3rd party advertising. 

A flat $200/year subscription gives you full access to everything CurlBook offers.

The app is free to download, and one game can be created as a trial without any commitment or signup. I will never hold your data hostage; even without a subscription you can *always* view previously generated data.
