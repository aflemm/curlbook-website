CurlBook introduced miss-types (i.e. thrower line inside) to curling analytics for the first time, and was used around the world by national teams, including Curling Canada.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe combination of career pressure, a very old codebase, and the incredible pace of change in the industry led me to retire the app in 2018. That decision, while the right one, has irked me for the past 7 years. Plainly put, I have missed CurlBook. Now, in light of my exciting \u003ca href=\"https://andrewflemming.net/career/\"\u003ecareer decisions\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to come back to this space and bring a brand new CurlBook to the world. This new app shares the CurlBook name, but it is entirely new and thoroughly modern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe new CurlBook is extremely visual, with charts and visualizations all throughout\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt’s focused on exposing trends and tendencies over multiple games, way beyond basic tv-style shooting percentages per game\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI’ve tried to make it as flexible and adaptable as possible (with everything being optional and editable, and a custom tag-based tracking system).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s so much more to say, and I\u0026rsquo;ve got so much more I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to bring to this new CurlBook, but for now I just hope you\u0026rsquo;ll check it out and see if CurlBook can help your team.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":"2025-02-06T09:00:00-04:00","permalink":"https://curlbook.ca/blog/2025/curlbook-is-back/","title":"CurlBook is Back!"}]}
