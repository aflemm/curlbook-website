I built the original CurlBook in 2009, and for some context I was developing it for an iPhone 3G, and the iPad didn&rsquo;t even exist yet. CurlBook introduced miss-types (i.e. thrower line inside) to curling analytics for the first time, and was used around the world by national teams, including Curling Canada.
The combination of career pressure, a very old codebase, and the incredible pace of change in the industry led me to retire the app in 2018. That decision, while the right one, has irked me for the past 7 years. Plainly put, I have missed CurlBook. Now, in light of my exciting career decisions, I&rsquo;ve been able to come back to this space and bring a brand new CurlBook to the world. This new app shares the CurlBook name, but it is entirely new and thoroughly modern."><meta name=author content="Andrew Flemming"><link rel=canonical href=https://curlbook.ca/blog/2025/curlbook-is-back/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b30ace296b0722c780cf0d4f06655375de97d27a380b81e99bdde39592b0c74e.css integrity="sha256-swrOKWsHIseAzw1PBmVTdd6X0no4C4Hpm93jlZKwx04=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://curlbook.ca/favicon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://curlbook.ca/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://curlbook.ca/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://curlbook.ca/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://curlbook.ca/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://curlbook.ca/blog/2025/curlbook-is-back/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script src=https://getinsights.io/js/insights.js></script><script>insights.init("QWsAnCOcEY9CRegC"),insights.trackPages()</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://curlbook.ca/blog/2025/curlbook-is-back/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="CurlBook"><meta property="og:title" content="CurlBook is Back!"><meta property="og:description" content="I am beyond excited to be launching CurlBook today … again.
