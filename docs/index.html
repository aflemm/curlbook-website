<h2 id="your-assistant-coach">Your Assistant Coach</h2>
<p>A single game of curling is a very large, multi-variable dataset. An event, or season&rsquo;s worth of games even more-so. Trends and tendencies are not always obvious, but they can make or break your season.</p>
<p>This is where software can step in and help. Let CurlBook crunch the numbers, and expose the strengths and vulnerabilities your team can&rsquo;t afford to miss.</p>
<p>CurlBook is also a fantastic for scouting your opposition. If you knew a team&rsquo;s second was routinely over-curling on their out-turn hits, would you incorporate that into your game plan? What if your opposition knew that about you?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/error-analysis.png"></p>
<p>CurlBook tracks shot errors and shot issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Errors are the way a shot is missed (heavy, light, inside, outside)</li>
<li>Issues are the root causes (brooming, thrower, sweepers, line-call)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes-with-context">Notes, With Context</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/note-capture-blank.png"></p>
<p>During a game, instant note capture is always at your fingertips. More than just a thought, CurlBook saves the context of each note when you create it. Whether it&rsquo;s the current shot, end, or game; either team; or a player, your note will always have the context it needs to be useful.</p>
<p>After the game, all of your notes are collected in one convenient location, never buried.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/curlbook-screenshot-drawing.png"></p>
<p>Sometimes a picture can say 1000 words, and CurlBook drawings are super fast and easy to generate. Have situation worth reviewing? A few taps, maybe some scribbles, and it&rsquo;s saved for post-game.</p>
<h2 id="data--insights">Data → Insights</h2>
<p>The value of collecting game data is in the insights it generates. We don&rsquo;t hand our MVP awards, we look to uncover the critical trends that will win and lose games in the futre. Knowing this, we can reinforce good trends and course-correct bad ones.</p>
<p>CurlBook presents trends over time so it&rsquo;s crystal clear how your practice is paying off.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/miss-rate-trend.png"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/win-loss-hammers.png"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/hammer-defence-trends.png"></p>
<h2 id="your-data-visualized">Your Data, Visualized</h2>
<p>CurlBook shows you a curling game like never seen it before. By being extremely visual with data presentation, the data becomes far more impactful.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/scoreboard-story.png">
Scoreboard story line plots show the flow of scoreboard control through a game. Instantly see the ends that got you into trouble, for quick focusing on real problems.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/player-performance.png">
Performance timeline bar charts highlight misses, and make trends obvious at a glance. No more digging through shot scores to uncover meaning</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/key-stats-breakdown.png">
CurlBook introduces brand new stats to help you track performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make-rate is the percentage of shots scored as 3 or 4, and represents the ratio of impactful shots.</li>
<li>Miss-rate is opposite, the percentage of shots scored as 0 or 1, and represents the ratio of damaging shots</li>
<li>TV stat is the traditional television-broadcast style scoring percentage</li>
<li>Weighted performance is similar to TV stat but with negative weighting to misses, and it does a better job at highlighting changes in performance</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/shot-result-distribution.png"></p>
<h2 id="fast--flexible">Fast &amp; Flexible</h2>
<p>CurlBook is fast and easy to use. With an intuitive and iPad-native interface, CurlBook keeps the distraction to a minimum. If you&rsquo;re in a hurry, starting a game takes only one tap. After it&rsquo;s started, everything can be edited later (teams, lineups, event, colours, hammer, etc.) so you&rsquo;re never stuck with a mis-configured game.</p>
<p>CurlBook can track as much or as little as you want to put into it. Just want to track draw weight? CurlBook&rsquo;s flexibility makes it the perfect tool for the job.</p>
<p>CurlBook features an extensible tags system allows you to track your own custom metrics, and every plot and chart can be filtered by your custom tags.</p>
<p>During data review, filters give you fine-grain control over what you see. Interested trends in low-precision out-turn hits by your front-end that were missed? CurlBook has you covered.</p>
<h2 id="supported-devices">Supported Devices</h2>
<p>CurlBook is compatible with any iPad running iOS 18.0 or later</p>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
<p>CurlBook is directly funded by its users, and sustainably priced to enable continuous development. I am not VC funded; I don&rsquo;t harvest data for resale; I won&rsquo;t nickel and dime with micro-transactions or upgrades; I will never employ 3rd party advertising.</p>
<p>A flat $200/year subscription gives you full access to everything CurlBook offers.</p>
<p>The app is free to download, and one game can be created as a trial without any commitment or signup. I will never hold your data hostage; even without a subscription you can <em>always</em> view previously generated data.</p>
<h2 id="just-the-beginning">Just the Beginning</h2>
<p>CurlBook is a modern platform that can grow and scale for years to come. I&rsquo;m really excited to share the journey with you.</p>
