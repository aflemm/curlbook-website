CurlBook is the best performance analytics software for curling teams. Fast, intuitive, and insightful, CurlBook will capture and display the data your team needs to win more games. Your Assistant Coach So much more than a curling stats app, CurlBook will expose trends and tendencies that are not always obvious, but can make or break your season.
A single game of curling is a very large, multi-variable dataset. An event, or season’s worth of games even more-so. Let CurlBook crunch the numbers, and expose the strengths and vulnerabilities your team can’t afford to miss."><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="CurlBook"><meta name=twitter:description content="CurlBook is the best performance analytics software for curling teams.

An event, or season&rsquo;s worth of games even more-so. Let CurlBook crunch the numbers, and expose the strengths and vulnerabilities your team can&rsquo;t afford to miss.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/error-analysis.png></p><div class=box-content><p>CurlBook tracks shot errors and shot issues</p><ul><li>Errors are the way a shot is missed (heavy, light, inside, outside)</li><li>Issues are the root causes (brooming, thrower, sweepers, line-call)</li></ul></div><h2 id=notes-with-context>Notes, With Context</h2><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/note-capture-blank.png></p><p>During a game, instant note capture is always at your fingertips. More than just a thought, CurlBook saves the context of each note when you create it. Whether it&rsquo;s the current shot, end, or game; either team; or a player, your note will always have the context it needs to be useful.</p><div class=box-content>After the game, all of your notes are collected right where you need them. Game, end, and shot notes are all presented together for post-game review. Notes on your opposition are ready for the next time you play against them.</div><h2 id=data--insights>Data → Insights</h2><p>The value of collecting game data is in the insights it generates. We don&rsquo;t hand out all-star awards, we look to uncover the critical trends that will win and lose games in the future. Knowing this, we can reinforce good trends and course-correct bad ones.</p><p>CurlBook presents trends over time so it&rsquo;s crystal clear how your practice is paying off.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/miss-rate-trend.png></p><div class=box-content>CurlBook is a fantastic tool for scouting your opposition. If you knew a team&rsquo;s second was routinely over-curling on their out-turn hits, would you incorporate that into your game plan? What if your opposition knew that about you?</div><h2 id=1000-words-or-one-picture>1000 Words, Or One Picture</h2><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/curlbook-screenshot-drawing.png></p><p>CurlBook drawings are super fast and easy to generate. Have situation worth reviewing? A few taps, maybe some scribbles, and it&rsquo;s saved for post-game.</p><h2 id=your-games-visualized>Your Games, Visualized</h2><div class=box-content>CurlBook shows you a curling game like never seen it before. By being extremely visual with data presentation, the data becomes far more impactful.</div><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/scoreboard-story.png>
Scoreboard story line plots show the flow of scoreboard control through a game. Instantly see the ends that got you into trouble to quickly focus on real problems.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/player-performance.png>
Performance timeline bar charts highlight misses, and make trends obvious at a glance. No more digging through shot scores to uncover meaning. It&rsquo;s seriously the best way to review a curling game.</p><div class=box-content><p>The simple shooting percentages shown on television broadcasts are designed for viewer-entertainment, not team development.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/key-stats-breakdown.png></p><p>CurlBook introduces new stats designed to help you more fully understand your performance. Make rate and miss rate express how often your team or players are throwing shots that either positively or negatively impact the strategy of the end. Weighted performance is similar to the tv broadcast percentage, but by weighting misses negatively is does a far better job at highlighting changes.</p></div><h2 id=check-out-your-season>Check Out Your Season</h2><p>A game in isolation is important, but trends over the season are what really matter. See your results at a glance, dive deeper into your scoreboard and first-hammer performance, look for tendencies over all of your games and shots.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/win-loss-hammers.png></p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/hammer-defence-trends.png></p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/shot-result-distribution.png></p><h2 id=fast--flexible>Fast & Flexible</h2><p>CurlBook is fast and easy to use. With an intuitive and iPad-native interface, CurlBook keeps the distraction to a minimum. If you&rsquo;re in a hurry, starting a game takes only one tap. After it&rsquo;s started, everything can be edited later (teams, lineups, event, colours, hammer, etc.) so you&rsquo;re never stuck with a mis-configured game.</p><p>CurlBook can track as much or as little as you want to put into it. Just want to track draw weight? CurlBook&rsquo;s flexibility makes it the perfect tool for the job.</p><p>CurlBook features an extensible tags system which allows you to track your own custom metrics, and every plot and chart can be filtered by your custom tags.</p><div class=box-content>During data review, filters give you fine-grain control over what you see. Want to see trends in low-precision out-turn hits that were missed by your front-end? CurlBook has you covered.</div><h2 id=supported-devices>Supported Devices</h2><p>CurlBook is compatible with any iPad running iOS 18.0 or later</p><h2 id=pricing>Pricing</h2><p>CurlBook is directly funded by its users, and sustainably priced to enable continuous development.
